The project design documentï¼š

1. If there was a Guavabot on every node, what sequence of scouts and remotes would you do to get them all home?

   MST for this one. Note that no scout is needed since we know every bot's location. 

   

2. More generally, if you knew where all the bots were, what sequence of scouts and remotes would you do to get them all home?

   For this part note the trade off between the MST and the shortest path it's not necessary to take detour. Use of the students is not trival. 

   

3. If you didn't care about getting the bots home and just wanted to find their locations as quickly as possible, what sequence of scouts and remotes would you do?

   After knowing the use of the students, we would proceed to this step. 

   

4. What ideas do you have for solvers? Please provide at least 2. What are their advantages/disadvantages?

     

   

5. What kinds of inputs do you think your solvers will do well on? Do poorly on?
